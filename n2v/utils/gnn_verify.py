"""
Verification specifications for GNN (GraphStar) reachability outputs.

A GNN reach set is a list of GraphStars over an (N, F_out) node-feature matrix.
Properties are expressed over the row-major flattened output space
(``index = node * F_out + feature``), matching :meth:`GraphStar.to_star`, and
delegated to the existing :func:`n2v.utils.verify_specification`, whose
``_is_disjoint`` already flattens any set exposing ``to_star``.

The typical specification is a per-node output box: prove that every selected
node-feature output stays within ``[lb, ub]``.  Under approximate (over-
approximate) reachability the verdict is ``'verified'`` or ``'unknown'``; a
definitive ``'falsified'`` requires a concrete counterexample (e.g. sampling),
which is out of scope here.
